To set up this, make this the current working directory and do the 
//to create the docker image
1.docker build -t store-analysis . 
//creates the container with a sharedvolume
2.docker run -d --name store-analysis -v shared_volume:/svolume store-analysis

Similar to making the data-generator, but make sure this is created after the data-generator not before it.
